Day01

#task 0:
Today, we will stay on PHP in command line. Start by creating a small program,
quite simple, called hw.php. This program must greet the world with its famous message.

#task 1:
Nope, what you need to create, is a program that can
display 1000 times the letter X, a newline, and with the constraint that it cannot go over 100 chars.

#task 2:
Create a program in php that will kindly ask of you a pile number, and that will inform you if it’s even (therefore washed with Olympia) or if it’s odd.
Pay attention to the example, in particular spaces, the uppercases and the exact
messages. At the end, it a ’CTRL-D’ to exit. And the readline library is not a part of the standard PHP library.

#task 3:
Create the ft_split function. It will take a string as argument, and will return a sorted array with the different words, initially separated by one or more spaces from the original string. Your ft_split.php submited will be included in a php test file.

#task 4:
Very basic, this program displays its command line arguments in the order received. The name of the program isn’t displayed.

#task 5:
This program takes one unique argument and reduces to a single space between each word, and none at the beginning and at the end of the string. There are only spaces, no tabulation or anything.

#task 6:
Do not confuse it with the enterprise management software SAP, it is for you the
chance to mix the prior two exercises. The sum of words contained in all the arguments (except the name of the program itself) are splited, sorted and displayed.

#task 7:
Your program will take a string as argument, and will place the first word (space separated) at the last spot. The whole thing is then re- presented, with 1 space only between each word.

#task 8:
You need to create a little function that will reply true or false according to whether the array passed as argument is sorted or not.

#task 9:
Get back to your ssap.php. You need to do the same thing again (take all the words from all the parameters and sort them) but you need to change the sorting rule: now it will need to be case insensitive and place all the characters in alphabetical order first, then numbers, and finally all the other characters, each in the following 3 groups following the ASCII order.

#task 10:
This PHP program will take 3 arguments. The second is an arithmetic operation amongst : ’+’, ’-’, ’*’, ’/’, ’%’. The first and the third are numbers. You need to make this operation and display the result. The program doesn’t manage errors, except the number of arguments given. Spaces and tabulations can be presented in all 3 arguments.
